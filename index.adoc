== Kabanero

Kabanero is an open source project that brings together foundational open source technologies into a modern microservices-based framework. Kabanero provides an end-to-end solution that enables you to architect, build, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes-based applications with more speed than ever.

Kabanero brings together architecture, development, and operations through the use of integrated application stacks. Architects and operations can include their companyâ€™s standards for aspects like security and build pipelines customized for their developers use.
