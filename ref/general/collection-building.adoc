= Building the collections locally

. Clone the collections repository and create a new copy of it in your git organization
+
----
git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections.git
git remote add private-org https://github.acme.com/my_org/collections.git
git push -u private-org
cd collections
----
+
Once this has been done, you will have your own copy of the collections repository in your own Git org/repo. Follow any normal development processes you have for using git (i.e., creating branches, etc.).

. Create organizational-level teams in Git that should administer the cloned collection(s), and add members to those teams.

. Set up a Kabanero Custom Resource instance to target the new collections
* Specify the repository URL in the Kabanero document (object) to point to a cloned, customized `index.yaml` for the master collection.  The URL setting is in the `Spec.Collections.Repositories` section of the Kabanero Custom Resource (CR) instance.
You can either alter the Kabanero CR instance that already exists, or delete it and create a new one.
* In the Kabanero CR instance, specify:
** git organization in the `organization` field
** git team name(s) in the `teams` field
** the api github url in the `apiurl` field

. Create or modify the collections if required.
* You can find out more about https://github.com/appsody/website/blob/master/content/docs/stacks/create.md[creating or modifying collections, window="_blank"].

. Set up local build environment.

There are several tools that are used to build.:::
* yq
** Command-line YAML processor  (sudo snap install yq)
* docker
** A tool to help you build and run apps within containers

These are only required if you are also building the Codewind Index (export CODEWIND_INDEX=true):::

* python3
** Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language
* pyyaml
** YAML parser and emitter for python (pip3 install pyyaml)

. There are several environment variables that need to be set up. These are required in order to correctly build the collections.
+
----
# Organization for images
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_ORG=kabanero

# Whether to build the Codewind Index file
export CODEWIND_INDEX=false
----
+
These settings are also required to correctly release the collections (if done manually):
+
----
# Publish images to image registry
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_PUBLISH=false

# Credentials for publishing images:
export IMAGE_REGISTRY=<registry>
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<registry_username>
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<registry_password>
----

. Build collections.
+
From the base directory, run the build script.  For example:
+
----
. ./ci/build.sh
----
+
Note that this will build all the collections in the incubator directory.
+
Following the build, you can find the generated collection assets in the `file://$PWD/ci/assets/` directory and all the docker images in your local docker registry.

. Test the collections.
+
To test the collections, add the `kabanero-index.yaml` to Appsody using the Appsody CLI:
+
----
appsody repo add kabanero file://$PWD/ci/assets/kabanero-index-local.yaml
----
+
This will enable you to do an `appsody init` for a collection that is in the newly built kabanero collections.  For example:
+
----
appsody init kabanero/java-microprofile
----

. Push changes back to your repository:
* Once you have made all the changes to the collection and you are ready to push the changes back to your git repository then
+
----
# Commit your changes back to git
git commit -a -m "Updates to the collections"

# Push the changes to your repository.   For example:
git push -u private-org
----
+
If Travis CI has been setup in your git organization, the push to git should trigger the Travis build to run, which will ensure that the changes build OK.

. Release the final version of the collections.
* Once all changes have been made to the Collections and they are ready to be released, if a full release of the collections is required, create a git tag:
+
----
git tag "v0.1.1 -m "Collections v0.1.1"
# push the tags to git:
git push --tags
----
+
This will trigger another Travis build that will also generate a Git Release and push the images to the image repository.

. Test the pipelines and other components that have been included in the collection within the Kabanero/OpenShift environment.

. Declare the release final.
