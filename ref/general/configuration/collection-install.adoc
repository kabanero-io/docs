= Configuring Kabanero to use an alternative collection repository

A Kabanero custom resource (CR) instance can be configured to use an alternative collection repository.  When you have created a new collection repository, as described in
link:https://kabanero.io/guides/working-with-collections/[Working with collections], follow these steps to use that collection repository with Kabanero:

. Create organizational-level teams in GitHub to administer the cloned collection(s), and add members to those teams.  These members will be able to use the link:../reference/kabanero-cli.html[Kabanero CLI] to administer the collections in the namespace where the Kabanero CR instance is configured.

. Obtain the URL to the collection repository.  If a Git release was created for the collections, the URL format will be: `https://<github.com>/<organization>/collections/releases/download/<release>/kabanero-index.html`
* Replace `<github.com>` with your GitHub or GHE hostname
* Replace `<organization>` with your GitHub organization name
* Replace `<release>` with the name of the release that was created

. Find the name of your Kabanero CR instance.  Use `oc get kabaneros -n kabanero` to obtain a list of all Kabanero CR instances in namespace `kabanero`.  The default name for the CR instance is `kabanero`.  Then, edit the specific CR instance using `oc edit kabanero <name> -n kabanero`, replacing `<name>` with the instance name.

. Modify your Kabanero CR instance to target the new collections that were pushed to the remote GitHub repository and the teams in GitHub that will administer the collection(s).  Specifically:
* The `Spec.Collections.Repositories.url` attribute should be set to the URL of the alternative collection repository.
* Refer to link:github-authorization.html[authorizing the Kabanero CLI service] for instructions on defining authorization to the GitHub teams.

A modified Kabanero CR instance for a collection repository located in the `my_org` organization of the `github.example.com` GitHub repository using release `0.3.0` of collections might look like this:
+
```yaml
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kabanero
metadata:
  name: kabanero
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  collections:
    repositories:
    - name: custom
      url: https://github.example.com/my_org/collections/releases/download/0.3.0/kabanero-index.yaml
      activateDefaultCollections: true
  github:
    organization: my_org
    teams:
      - collection-admins
      - admins
    apiUrl: https://api.github.com
```
+
For more information about other fields that can be customized in the Kabanero CR instance, see link:kabanero-cr-config.html[Configuring a Kabanero CR instance].
+
After editing, save your changes.  The updated Kabanero CR instance is applied to your cluster.

. The Kabanero operator will now load the collections in the repository.  To see a list of all collections in the `kabanero` namespace, use `oc get collections -n kabanero`.  If the kabanero-operator is unable to apply the collections, the `Status` section of the Kabanero CR instance or the Collection CR instances will contain more information.
