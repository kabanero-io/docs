= Configuring Kabanero to use an alternative stack repository

A Kabanero custom resource (CR) instance can be configured to use an alternative stack repository.  When you have published a new stack repository, as described in
link:https://appsody.dev/docs/stacks/publish[Publishing Stacks], follow these steps to use that stack index with Kabanero:

. Create organizational-level teams in GitHub to administer the cloned stacks, and add members to those teams.  These members will be able to use the link:../reference/kabanero-cli.html[Kabanero CLI] to administer the stacks in the namespace where the Kabanero CR instance is configured.

. Obtain the URL to the stack repository.  If a Git release was created for the stacks, the URL format might be: `https://<github.com>/<organization>/stacks/releases/download/<release>/incubator-index.html`
* Replace `<github.com>` with your GitHub or GHE hostname
* Replace `<organization>` with your GitHub organization name
* Replace `<release>` with the name of the release that was created

. Find the name of your Kabanero CR instance.  Use `oc get kabaneros -n kabanero` to obtain a list of all Kabanero CR instances in namespace `kabanero`.  The default name for the CR instance is `kabanero`.  Then, edit the specific CR instance using `oc edit kabanero <name> -n kabanero`, replacing `<name>` with the instance name.
+
Note: Avoid using the OpenShift Console to edit the Kabanero CR instance.  The console may change the `apiVersion` of the Kabanero CR instance from `v1alpha2` to `v1alpha1`.  There is a description of the issue link:https://github.com/openshift/console/issues/4444[here].

. Modify your Kabanero CR instance to target the new stacks that were pushed to the remote GitHub repository and the teams in GitHub that will administer the stacks.  Specifically:
* The `Spec.Stacks.Repositories.Https.url` attribute should be set to the URL of the alternative stack repository.
* Refer to link:github-authorization.html[authorizing the Kabanero CLI service] for instructions on defining authorization to the GitHub teams.

A modified Kabanero CR instance for a stack repository located in the `my_org` organization of the `github.example.com` GitHub repository using release `0.1.2` of stacks might look like this:
+
```yaml
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha2
kind: Kabanero
metadata:
  name: kabanero
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  stacks:
    repositories:
    - name: custom
      https:
        url: https://github.example.com/my_org/stacks/releases/download/0.1.2/incubator-index.yaml
    pipelines:
    - id: default
      sha256: 14285a7f0bb152759b3e2141db19d72ea1f94f01bbf5ffbf866cab4e60e093dd
      https:
        url: https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.5.0/incubator.common.pipeline.default.tar.gz
  github:
    organization: my_org
    teams:
      - stack-admins
      - admins
    apiUrl: https://api.github.com
```
+
For more information about other fields that can be customized in the Kabanero CR instance, see link:kabanero-cr-config.html[Configuring a Kabanero CR instance].
+
After editing, save your changes.  The updated Kabanero CR instance is applied to your cluster.

. The Kabanero operator will now load the stacks in the repository.  To see a list of all stacks in the `kabanero` namespace, use `oc get stacks -n kabanero`.  If the kabanero-operator is unable to apply the stacks, the `Status` section of the Kabanero CR instance or the Stack CR instances will contain more information.
+
Note that when replacing the stack index in the Kabanero CR instance, the Kabanero operator will not delete stacks that were present in the previous index, but not present in the current index.  To delete the removed stacks, run `kabanero sync` in the Kabanero CLI.  The `sync` may become the default behavior in a future release of Kabanero.
