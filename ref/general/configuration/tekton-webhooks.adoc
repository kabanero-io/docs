= Connecting to GitHub with webhooks

A webhook is an outbound HTTP request that helps you create a relationship between your GitHub repository and a particular URL, in this case a https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/blob/master/README.md[pipeline, window="_blank"]. After you configure the webhook, changes you make in your GitHub repository will trigger the pipeline and its associated tasks.

**Note:** There is now an events operator with an events mediator that requires only one webhook per organization. For more information, see the link:https://kabanero.io/guides/integrating-events-operator[Integrating the events operator] guide and the link:https://kabanero.io/doc/ref/general/reference/event-operator.html[Events operator specification] reference.

== Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository
* https://kabanero.io/docs/ref/general/installation/installing-kabanero-foundation.html[Kabanero Foundation, window="_blank"].
** The product operator installation will include an instance of the pipelines dashboard with the webhooks extension and triggers.

== Create a persistent volume
Pipelines need a persistent volume. For more information, see *Setting up a persistent volume to run pipelines* in the https://kabanero.io/guides/working-with-pipelines/[Working with pipelines, window="_blank"] guide.

== Generate a GitHub access token
You need to generate a GitHub personal access token to use for creating the webhook and for accessing the repository source code during PipelineRuns. To generate the token:

. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens[github.com/settings/tokens, window="_blank"] and click `Generate new token`.
. Check the `admin:repo_hook` option and click `Generate token`. If you are working in a private repository, more options might be required. Check with your administrator for details. *Make sure to save the token to a file because you can't see it after you leave this page.*

== Create secrets
If you are working with a private or enterprise GitHub repository, you need to store your access token in a Kubernetes secret. If you are working with a public GitHub repository, you do not need to create a secret for your pipelines dashboard webhook.

. From your pipelines dashboard, select `Secrets` from the sidebar menu and click `Add Secret`.
. Give your secret a unique name.
. For the `Namespace`, select `kabanero` from the drop-down list.
. For `Access To:`, select `Git Server` from the drop-down list.
. Enter your GitHub username and the personal access token you generated in the previous section.
. Select the service account that is used by the pipeline you want to trigger.

If you want to push the image to Docker Hub, you need to create a separate secret to connect to Docker Hub. Follow the same procedure but use your Docker Hub username and password. For `Access To:`, select `Docker Registry` from the drop-down list.

== Create a webhook
. From your pipelines dashboard, select `webhooks` from the sidebar menu and click `Add Webhook`.
. Enter your information in the `Create Webhook` window.
+
Name::
Give your webhook a distinctive name.

Repository URL::
The URL of the GitHub repository that you want to connect to.

Access token::
Use this field to create a secret to store your GitHub personal access token. Even if you already created a token-based Git secret from your pipelines dashboard, you must also store your GitHub personal access token in this field. Click the green plus icon beside the field to open the `Create Access Token Secret` window.
+
Give your access token secret a descriptive name. In the `Access token` field, enter the GitHub personal access token that you previously generated in the <<#gat,Generate a GitHub access token step>>.

Namespace::
Select the Kubernetes namespace in which you want to run your pipeline. In this case, choose `kabanero`.

Pipeline::
Select the pipeline in your target Namespace. PipelineRuns (and their accompanying PipelineResources) are created in this namespace. For more information, see https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines#kabanero-pipelines[Pipelines, window="_blank"].

Service Account::
Select a service account to be used by the PipelineRun. There are two default service account options. Either of these accounts can be used as a template to create your own customized service accounts that fit your pipeline requirements.

* If you are deploying pipelines in a single namespace, the `pipeline` service account is provided, which has permissions to build and push an image. This service account can be used with simple pipelines. However, it has limited access to the current namespace and does not work for cross-namespace operations and deployments.

* If you need to deploy pipelines across multiple namespaces, the product operator provides the `kabanero-pipeline` service account with this capability. If you are running a custom pipeline that requires more or less access than the kabanero-pipeline service account is configured to provide, do not edit this account. Instead, create a new service account, such as `custom-kabanero-pipeline-sa`, and configure it according to your needs. For example service accounts, see the link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/tree/master/pipelines/[pipelines repo, window="_blank"].

Docker registry::
Select the Docker registry where any built images are pushed. Use the same Docker registry that you created a secret for previously. For Docker Hub, use `index.docker.io/<docker_id>`. For an internal registry, use `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/kabanero`. If the namespace that is associated with your internal registry is not `kabanero`, use `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/your-namespace`.

. After you complete the necessary information, click `Create`.

== Confirm your webhook

. Look for the webhook in your GitHub Repository.
* From your GitHub repository, go to the `settings` tab and select `Webhooks` from the sidebar menu. Look for the webhook you created. Sometimes the webhook initially shows a 504 error icon but after the webhook is used it changes to a green check mark.

. Update code and merge a pull request (PR).
* Make any update to your code, create a PR, and merge it. This change kicks off a PipelineRun.

. Check the PipelineRun from your pipelines dashboard.
* From your pipelines dashboard, select `PipelineRuns` from the sidebar menu. Look for the PipelineRun you just kicked off.

Your GitHub repo is connected using a webhook. Changes in your code can now automatically trigger tasks that are specified by the pipeline. If you don't see a PipelineRun in your dashboard, see the https://kabanero.io/docs/ref/general/reference/troubleshooting.html#errors-when-using-a-webhook-to-trigger-pipelines[troubleshooting guide].

== Deleting a webhook

You can delete an existing webhook using your pipelines dashboard.

. From your pipelines dashboard, select `webhooks` from the sidebar menu.
. Select the webhooks that you want to delete by clicking the box beside the webhook name.
. Click `Delete`.
