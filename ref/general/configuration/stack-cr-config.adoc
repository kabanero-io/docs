= Stack Custom Resource

A `Stack` custom resource (CR) instance describes a particular application
stack. Multiple versions of the same stack can be described in the
same `Stack` CR instance.  

The `Spec` section of the `Stack` instance describes the desired
configuration. The `Status` section is populated by the Stack controller,
and shows which versions of the Stack have been activated, and which
pipelines and tasks have been activated for that version.

== Syntax (v1alpha2)

See the link:#examples[examples].  To define a `Stack` instance, you can
specify the following fields:

* `Spec`
** `name` - The name of the stack that is represented by this CR.
** `versions` - A list of versions of this stack that should be
   activated.  Each CR instance must define at least one version.
*** `version` - The version of this stack.
*** `desiredState` - An optional field which describes the state
    that this version of this stack should remain in.  An empty
    value results in this version being activated.  Other valid
    values are `active` and `inactive`. If either of these values
    is provided, the product operator will not attempt to change
    the state for this version, even if the stack is removed from
    the stack index which caused this Stack CR to be created.
    This behavior can be used to permanently activate or deactivate
    a stack, until the configuration is manually changed.
*** `skipRegistryCertVerification` - Controls whether the controller will
       validate SSL/TLS certificates presented by the registry hosting the
       stack's container image.
       Valid values are `true` and `false`.
*** `pipelines` - A list of pipelines which should be applied to
    this stack version.
**** `id` - A descriptive name of the pipelines contained at this URL.
**** `Sha256` - The digest of the pipelines contained at this
      URL.  Typically a command like `sha256sum` is used to obtain the
      digest.
**** `https` - Used for accessing pipelines via an unprotected URL.
     This field is mutually exclusive with the `gitRelease` field.  If
     both `https` and `gitRelease` are specified, the values in
     `gitRelease` are used.
***** `url` - The URL pointing to the pipelines.  Typically this file
       has a `.tar.gz` extension.  The URL will be accessed using
       HTTPS.
***** `skipCertVerification` - Controls whether the stack controller will
       validate SSL/TLS certificates presented by the pipelines URL.
       Valid values are `true` and `false`.
**** `gitRelease` - Used for accessing pipelines via a protected GitHub
      release.  This field is mutually exclusive with the `https` field.  If
      both `https` and `gitRelease` are specified, the values in
      `gitRelease` are used.  Authentication credentials ( via Kubernetes secret ) must be supplied - see
      link:ghe-credentials.html[Specifying Credentials to Access Protected GitHub Resources].
***** `hostname` - The host name where the GitHub release exists.
***** `organization` - The user name, or organization name, where the
       GitHub release exists.
***** `project` - The project where the GitHub release exists.
***** `release` - The name of the release within the GitHub project.
***** `assetName` - The name of the file (asset) within the release.
***** `skipCertVerification` - Controls whether the Kabanero controller will
       validate SSL/TLS certificates presented by the pipelines URL.
       Valid values are `true` and `false`.
*** `images` - A list of container images that are associated with
    this version of the stack.  A `PipelineRun` may include a step
    that validates that an application is build using an image that
    is included in this list.
**** `id` - A descriptive name of this image
**** `image` - The location of this image in the container registry.

== Inspecting your Stack CR instances

You can retrieve all the Stack CR instances in a namespace using this
command:

`oc get stacks -n kabanero -o yaml`

The example uses the kabanero namespace. To use a different namespace,
replace `-n kabanero` with the name of another namespace.

== Examples

This example yaml defines a `Stack` instance with a single version of
the `java-openliberty` stack:

```yaml
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha2
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: java-microprofile
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  name: java-microprofile
  versions:
    - pipelines:
        - https:
            url: >-
              https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.5.0/incubator.common.pipeline.default.tar.gz
          id: default
          sha256: 14285a7f0bb152759b3e2141db19d72ea1f94f01bbf5ffbf866cab4e60e093dd
      version: 0.2.21
```

This example is the same as the previous example, except uses the `gitRelease` field to specify the Pipelines zip:

```yaml
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha2
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: java-microprofile
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  name: java-microprofile
  versions:
    - pipelines:
        - gitRelease:
            hostname: "github.com"
            organization: "kabanero-io"
            project: "collections"
            release: "0.5.0"
            assetName: "incubator.common.pipeline.default.tar.gz"
          id: default
          sha256: 14285a7f0bb152759b3e2141db19d72ea1f94f01bbf5ffbf866cab4e60e093dd
      version: 0.2.21
```
