Kabanero version 0.6 has been tested on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.3. There is intent to expand testing to additional distributions, including upstream Kubernetes, in the future.

The Kabanero Open Project intends to build on open source distributions of Kubernetes; however, the current distribution of The Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) is lagging the commercial distributions. Due to a focus on building leading-edge capabilities and leveraging new features across the integrated open frameworks, the Kabanero Open Project is temporarily building on version 4 capabilities of the commercial distributions. When there is a comparable release of OKD, the Kabanero Open Project will return to it.

As a result of this temporary change in focus, there is no upgrade process from an installation built on OKD version 3.11 to an installation built on OCP 4.3.

== Prerequisites

* link:https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform[OCP] V4.3.0+

== Installation

Kabanero uses Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to manage its prerequisites. Several operators must be installed before Kabanero can be used. You can choose to perform a scripted installation or a manual installation. In the scripted installation, the provided installation script subscribes to and configures the prerequisite operators. If you prefer, the installation can be performed manually.

=== Scripted installation

. Obtain the installation script for the release of Kabanero that you wish to install.
* `curl -s -O -L https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-operator/releases/download/0.6.0/install.sh`

. Review the `install.sh` script for any optional components that can be enabled by setting the required environment variable, or by editing the value in the script directly. Optional components are listed at the top of the script, below the section titled `Optional components`.

. As a `cluster-admin`, run the script:
.. Ensure you are logged into your cluster with the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-logging-in_cli-developer-commands[`oc login` command]
.. If installing the optional kAppNav component, specify `yes` on the ENABLE_KAPPNAV environment variable.  If not, specify `no`.
.. `ENABLE_KAPPNAV=yes|no ./install.sh`

. As a `cluster-admin`, or as a user with `create` and `update` authority to the `kabaneros.kabanero.io` kind, create a custom resource (CR) instance. A sample `oc apply` command which applies the default instance for this release of Kabanero, including the default application stacks, is shown when the `install.sh` script finishes running. You can modify the CR instance to include the URL of an application stack and the GitHub information necessary to administer that application stack. For more information on customizing the CR instance, see link:/docs/ref/general/configuration/kabanero-cr-config.html[the CR configuration reference].

=== Manual installation

. Install and configure the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html[OpenShift Serverless Operator].

. Install the pipelines operator using the instructions to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[add an operator to your cluster]. Select the `community-operators` catalog and the `dev-preview` channel.

. Install the microservice deployment operator using the instructions to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[add an operator to your cluster]. Select the `certified-operators` catalog and the `beta` channel. This operator should be installed at the cluster scope.

. Install the OLM CatalogSource containing the product operator. The following YAML can be used, after substituting the required version (the example uses version 0.6.0):
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: kabanero-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: kabanero/kabanero-operator-registry:0.6.0
----

. Create the `kabanero` namespace using `oc new-project kabanero`

. Install the Che operator using the instructions to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[add an operator to your cluster]. Select the `community-operators` catalog and the `stable` channel. This operator should be installed to the `kabanero` namespace.

. Install the product operator using the instructions to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[add an operator to your cluster]. Select the `kabanero-catalog` catalog and the `release-0.4` channel. This operator should be installed to the `kabanero` namespace.

. As a `cluster-admin`, or as a user with `create` and `update` authority to the `kabaneros.kabanero.io` kind, create a custom resource (CR) instance. A sample `oc apply` command which applies the default instance for this release of Kabanero, including the default application stacks, is shown when the `install.sh` script finishes running. You can modify the CR instance to include the URL of an application stack and the GitHub information necessary to administer that application stack. For more information on customizing the CR instance, see link:/docs/ref/general/configuration/kabanero-cr-config.html[the CR configuration reference].

== After installation

**Important:** Due to the addition of Triggers in Kabanero version 0.5, and an update to Triggers in Kabanero version 0.6, if you are upgrading to Kabanero version 0.5 or later from any previous version, you must delete any existing webhooks and create them again. See link:/docs/ref/general/configuration/tekton-webhooks.html[Connecting Kabanero to GitHub with Webhooks] for instructions on deleting and creating webhooks.

The **Kabanero Console** is installed as part of the install process and is a good next step to go explore information about your Kabanero instance.

=== View the Console's landing page

There are two ways to get the console's URL::

Using the `oc` CLI:::
. Open a terminal and run: `oc get routes -n kabanero`
. Find the result with the name `kabanero-landing`. The URL is displayed under **HOST/PORT** for that row.

Using the OpenShift Console:::
. Switch the project to **kabanero**
. Under **Applications** click **Routes**
. The landing page name is **kabanero-landing**, which should be in the list of routes; click the URL under **Hostname** to open the landing application

=== If the landing page is not responding
It might take some time for the landing page and other pods to be created and started. You can check the status of the product pods with `oc get pods -n kabanero`. Wait until they all have a status of *Running*.
----
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
kabanero-landing-6dc5c798d4-ncg52     1/1       Running   0          11m
----

=== Configure OAuth for the Kabanero Console

You can add optional features to help you manage your application stacks, but it requires you setup OAuth for the console. To setup OAuth follow the instructions for link:/docs/ref/general/configuration/console-oauth.html[Configuring OAuth for the product console].

== (Optional sample) Application deployment project with manual pipeline run

You can build and deploy a simple java-microprofile application using the default java-microprofile pipelines by following these steps:

=======

. Retrieve the installation scripts from the kabanero-foundation repository
* Clone the repository to get the scripts: `git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-foundation.git`

. Navigate to the scripts directory: `cd kabanero-foundation/scripts`

. Ensure that you are logged in to your cluster with the `oc login` command

. Create a persistent volume (PV) for the pipeline to use; a sample hostPath `pv.yaml` is provided
* `oc apply -f pv.yaml`

. Create the pipeline and execute the example manual pipeline run
* `APP_REPO=https://github.com/dacleyra/appsody-hello-world/ ./example-tekton-pipeline-run.sh`

. Access the application at `http://appsody-hello-world.kabanero.<MY_OPENSHIFT_MASTER_DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN>`
* By default, the application container image is built and pushed to the Internal Registry, and then deployed serverless

. (Optional) Access the pipeline logs
* `oc logs $(oc get pods -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun=java-microprofile-manual-pipeline-run -n kabanero --output="jsonpath={.items[0].metadata.name}") -n kabanero --all-containers`

. (Optional) Make detailed pipeline changes by accessing the pipelines dashboard
* `http://tekton-dashboard.<MY_OPENSHIFT_MASTER_DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN>`
