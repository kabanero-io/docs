title: What's New In Kabanero 0.9.0
---

We proudly present the latest version of the Kabanero project, version 0.9.0! Let's get right to it.

We've created an exciting new events operator and mediator, which needs only one webhook per organization. We've included a new guide and reference documentation to get you started with this feature.

Also, we've added GitOps to pipelines, added a pre-deploy decision point to governance, made several improvements and bug fixes in the landing page and the Kabanero CLI, and deprecated the `java-microprofile` stack in favor of the `java-openliberty` stack.

For more information about these and other updates, see the [Whatâ€™s New in 0.9.0 blog post](/blog/2020/05/15/WhatsNew090.html).
