Today, Kabanero has been tested on the Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes(OKD) version 3.11. There is intent to also expand testing on additional distributions including upstream Kubernetes in the future.

== Prerequisites

* Kubernetes is installed
* openshift_master_default_subdomain is configured
** See https://docs.okd.io/3.11/install/configuring_inventory_file.html[Configuring Your Inventory File, window="_blank"]
* Wildcard DNS is available for your subdomain
** alternatively, nip.io can be used
* The Internal Registry is configured
** See more about the https://docs.okd.io/3.11/install_config/registry/index.html[Internal Registry, window="_blank"]

== Installation

. In a terminal session, create and `cd` to a temporary working directory of your choice.

. Retrieve the https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-foundation/tree/master/scripts[installation scripts from our kabanero-foundation repository, window="_blank"]
* Clone the repository to get the scripts `git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-foundation.git`

. Navigate to the **scripts** directory: `cd kabanero-foundation/scripts`

. Ensure you are logged into your cluster with the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[`oc login` command]

. Review the `install-kabanero-foundation.sh` script for any optional components that can be enabled by setting the required environment variable, or by editing the value in the script directly.  Optional components are listed at the top of the script, below the section titled `Optional components`.

. As a `cluster-admin`, run the following:
* Don't forget to replace `<MY_OPENSHIFT_MASTER_DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN>` with your subdomain, and do not include the angle brackets:
* `openshift_master_default_subdomain=<MY_OPENSHIFT_MASTER_DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN> ./install-kabanero-foundation.sh`

. Create a `Kabanero` custom resource (CR) instance.  A sample `oc apply` command which applies the default instance for this release of Kabanero, including the default collections, is printed at the conclusion of the `install-kabanero-foundation.sh` script.  The CR instance can be modified to include the URL of a custom collection, and the Github information necessary to administer that collection.  For more information on customizing the CR instance, see link:kabanero-cr-config.html[the Kabanero CR configuration reference].

== Optional sample - Appsody project with manual Tekton pipeline run

. Create a Persistent Volume for the pipeline to use. A sample hostPath `pv.yaml` is provided.
* `oc apply -f pv.yaml`

. Create the pipeline and execute the example manual pipeline run
* `APP_REPO=https://github.com/dacleyra/appsody-hello-world/ ./appsody-tekton-example-manual-run.sh`

. By default, the application container image will be built and pushed to the Internal Registry, and then deployed as a Knative Service.
* Access the application at: `http://appsody-hello-world.appsody-project.<MY_OPENSHIFT_MASTER_DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN>`

. Optional - Access the pipeline logs
* `oc logs $(oc get pods -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun=manual-pipeline-run --output=jsonpath={.items[0].metadata.name}) --all-containers`

. Optional - Make detailed pipeline changes by accessing the Tekton dashboard
* `http://tekton-dashboard.<MY_OPENSHIFT_MASTER_DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN>`
